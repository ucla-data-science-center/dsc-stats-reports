    "text": "The DSC puts on events for the UCLA community and for the larger UC system in collaboration with other campuses. We manage the UCLA Carpentries program and provide a community for over 15 instructors on campus. We have also catalyzed a UC-wide Carpentries community and, over the pandemic, developed collaborative programming and workshop events. The success of this model has led to collaborative work in the development of UC Love Data Week in 2021 and subsequent years. In a similar vein, UC GIS Week was started in 2020 by GIS professionals in the UC system. We think these UC collaborative educational events will be a permanent fixture even as we offer more traditional local instruction.\nOur workshops typically address skills gaps in data science and foundational coding for researchers, staff, and librarians. We also contribute to curricula and train-the-trainer best practices through a global network.\nTo get a sense of the growth of events organized, taught & designed by DSC instructors, let us look at attendance over time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2017, our workshops have been attended by 148 different departments, schools, centers or units from UCLA.\nWe can look at the top departments who attend our workshops:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA look at the affiliation of learners who come to our workshops."

    "section": "Consultations",
    "text": "Consultations\nWe work with researchers one-on-one to help them accomplish their research goals. Prior to the pandemic, we provided consultations both online and in-person, depending on the researchers’ preferences. We estimate that prior to March 2020, we provided consultations online approximately 10-15% of the time. During the pandemic, we moved our service to online only and restarted in-person consulting in 2023 on a smaller scale as a pilot. Regardless of how users access our service, it has shown growth over time. With the move to the first floor of YRL in 2024, we anticipate more business due to the improved visibility of our location and the addition of more walk-in hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsulting by Department\nSince 2019, when we started capturing more user information, our consultations have come from 115 different departments, schools, or centers. We include The Library in this number because, as a secondary and sometimes tertiary referral point, we often work with liaising librarians and internal units needing data support. For 2023, we provided data services to 51 campus departments.\nHistorically, we didn’t require patrons to provide departmental information in our appointment scheduler, so the data may be incomplete. While we’ve normalized departments, schools, and centers as much as possible, some variability remains. Despite this, the data shows that DSC services are interdisciplinary, aligning with our vision to broaden the library’s data services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Status\nWhen provided, we also collect information on our users’ status."

These tasks include various research support activities, managed and tracked by DSC staff who act as mentors.
